Hello!
=====

I'm a 2nd year PhD student at University of Massachusetts Amherst in the Computer Science department. 

Research Interests
=====

My research is focused around understanding how people interact with technological tools/platforms to create a better experience. This spans over social media platforms, tools to support programmers, and LLMs. 

More About Me
=====

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, board games, knitting, reading, and spending time with my two cats.
